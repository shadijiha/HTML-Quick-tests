			True damage is a new form of damage that ignores target's <img title="Armor icon" src="../Data/Images/armor.png" /> armor and damage reduction
			<br />
			<br />			
			If true damage critical strikes, it appears as a white critical strike <img src="../Data/Images/true_critical_strike_chance_icon.png" /> icon instead of orange
